              <h2>About </h2>
              <p>Hello, My name is PM Sharma Growing up in Maharashtra, India, I was always fascinated by the natural world and the mysteries of mechanics. It was no surprise when I decided to pursue a degree in Mechanical Engineering, and I graduated in 2022 with a strong foundation in the subject.</p>
              <p>However, the COVID-19 pandemic brought a lot of changes and free time into my life. As I was stuck at home, I found myself with a lot of extra hours to fill and started watching documentaries to pass the time. One in particular caught my attention: "Internet's Own Boy" a film about Aaron Swartz, a programmer and internet activist who fought for open access to information.</p>
      
              <p>
                  As I watched, I was struck by Aaron's passion for his work and the impact he was able to make on the world through programming. I realized that I wanted to feel the same sense of purpose and drive in my own career. So, I made the decision to become a programmer.
              </p>
      
              <p>
                  I started learning as much as I could, focusing on frontend development and experimenting with technologies like Nextjs, React, Tailwindcss,  and Typescript. It wasn't always easy, but I was motivated by the idea of being able to build something that could make a difference. I always on the lookout for new projects to work on and ways to improve my skills.
              </p>
              <p>
                  In my free time, I enjoy playing music and gardening. If you happen to be in Ichalkaranji, where I currently live, maybe we can grab a coffee or code together. You can see a list of my full projects here. .
              </p>
              <p>
                  Outside of programming, I am also passionate about dreaming up new ideas and making them a reality. There is nothing quite like the feeling of bringing a project from concept to completion, and I am constantly learning new things as I work.
              </p>
              <p>
                  You can find me on GitHub and Twitter, I am always happy to connect with other programmers and learn from each other. 
              </p>
